3D 2-Player Aeroplane Dogfighting is a fast-paced split-screen game where two players each control a fighter plane in a vibrant, 3D world filled with fields, houses, roads, and clouds. Each player navigates their plane, maneuvers through the skies, and tries to outfly and outshoot their opponent in intense aerial combat. Score hits to reduce your rival’s health and prove who’s the top ace! The game is designed for head-to-head action, with both players sharing the screen and enjoying their own viewpoint for an immersive dogfighting experience.
